2.DNO/ STAR Proxy
3.CDN/ Star Client

*****************INSTALLATION GUIDE*****************

These are the steps to get the whole simulation going:

- Prepare 3 VM using ubuntu: Server, Proxy, Client

Prepare the Server:

- In your home directory create: ~/gopath/src/github.com/letsencrypt/boulder and place all the files there.(the files that are currently in https://github.com/diegoDAguilar/B
Boulder. NOTE: When you have everything copied you should't have a boulderStar file,
everything must be inside letsencrypt/boulder/, if you do an "ls" in letsencrypt/boulder/, it must return the files that are currently under boulderStar/boulder).
Using "git clone https://github.com/diegoDAguilar/boulderStar" also works.
- Install GO and set environment variable PATH to /usr/local/go/bin. My version ($go version)  "go1.8.1 linux/amd64"
- Fully install Docker and Docker-Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ just follow the steps and test that the hello-world image works. I m using version 17.03.1-ce for Docker and version 1.12.0 for Docker-Compose.
- Go to boulder/test/config/va.json and make sure your port config in va is : 80 for httpPort, 5001 for httpsPort and 5001 for tlsPort.(Some of these changes may be redundant, but this way it works, so don't ask ;) )
- Go to boulder/docker-compose.yml and check that in the list of ports you have 80:80 and 443:443, be careful not to tab as it is an illegal char (these 2 steps are already done if you download my repo, do them if you are using common Boulder)
- Back in boulder/docker-compose.yml change the FAKE_DNS field to the IP of the VM that will act as your server.
- Set ufw status to inactive: sudo ufw disable
- Check your iptables policy: "sudo iptables -L" and set CHAIN FORWARD policy to accept if it is currently in DROP mode: "sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT"
- Make sure you can reach the other machines with ICMP by pinging them and change the route table if needed.
- Open /etc/hosts and add these 2:

	172.17.0.4      acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org boulder //this is the local IP of Boulder at least in my machine
														//If using "ifconfig" in the server returns you an interface
														//called docker0 172.17.0.1, then it should be the same.

	"proxy's IP"  bye.com //this is the web hosted for the example. Because it is not available in the Web, the server must know that it is in the proxy machine, so here
	 											//we make sure of it.
-Get a selfsigned certificate and place it in ./boulder:
"openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365"
In my case the named CN "CertificateAuthoritySTAR", REMEMBER this name, because you will need to add it in the /etc/hosts file of the proxy.
Remember to not cypher the key file. If you accidentally did, use:
"openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pem"

Prepare the Proxy:

-The current proxy has been tested being root in the VM so: "sudo -i" and place a new directory there with all the files in https://github.com/diegoDAguilar/proxyStar so that the end directory of files such as proxySTAR.go and exeAutoRenew.sh is /root/
Again, using git clone is the fastest way.
- Go to certbot/ and type: "source ./venv/bin/activate" (You always need this ON so remember to execute this command again if you exit the VM). If it doesn't work,
type ""./tools/venv.sh" first.
- Declare global environment:  export SERVER=http://172.17.0.4:4000/directory    (this is where Boulder is listening)
- Install Go, my version ($go version) is : go1.8.2 linux/amd64
- Set GOPATH to /root/gopath and PATH to /root/go/bin
- Make the same ping and iptables checks that we did preparing the server: chain policy set to ACCEPT, pinging between vm.
- Host some website. This is the site for which we are gonna request the certificates. The way I did it is using Apache (e.g. bye.com):
	1. Place an html file in /var/www/bye.com/html/bye.html. An example could be:

	```<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
	<HTML>
	 <HEAD>
			<TITLE>
				 A Small bye placed in 192.168.122.125 PROXY
			</TITLE>
	 </HEAD>
	<BODY>
	 <H1>Bye</H1>
	 <P>This is a very minimal "bye bye cruel world" HTML document.</P>
	</BODY>
	</HTML>

	2. Go to /etc/apache2/sites-available and copy a file called 000-default.conf in the same directory as bye.com.conf: "sudo cp 000-default.conf bye.com.conf"
	3. Open this new file and make sure VirtualHost in the first line is set to *:80 and the rest of the fields look like this (although ServerAdmin isn't important for now so leave it out if you want):
				ServerAdmin info@bye.com
        ServerName bye.com
        ServerAlias www.bye.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/bye.com/html
  4. In sites-available run this commands:
    	sudo a2ensite bye.com.conf
    	sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
    	sudo service apache2 restart
- Now it comes the most difficult step: Preparing the proxy for the http challenge. This is the challenge that we will use in the request. Create 2 directories
so the result is like this:  /var/www/bye.com/html/.well-known/acme-challenge
- IMPORTANT: Now you have to make sure that you can access the directory acme-challenge, so place a hello.html file there and try to reach it with curl from the server,
if it works feel free to delete it. If it doesn't, change the file permissions going to /var/www and typing "sudo chmod -R 644 bye.com" and change the user so it isn't root:
"sudo chown -R user:user bye.com" <----IMPORTANT: user:user is your name and group, so if your user in the VM is Josh from the Goonies--> sudo chown -R Josh:Goonies bye.com

-For the simulation to work, you also need to generate a certificate using openSSL so that proxy and client can use https:
"openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365" This generates a certificate and a key that have to be kept in the same directory
as proxySTAR.go, I am including a cert and key in the Github, but they may be outdated.

-Give execution permisions to all bash scripts executing in /root/: "sudo +x chmod *.sh"
-Make a new file called starCerts in /root/ and create a txt file called "myDomains.txt" with all the domains you want to be able to delegate. This file shall contain a list
of all the domains you may delegate. The format is domain and new line. E.g. cat myDomains.txt should return:

bye.com
heelo.comp
imRunningOutOfIdeas.com

-Last step. Create a file in /root/ called "serverKey" and create a text file "cert.pem":
"mkdir serverKey"
"nano cert.pem"

This is the selfsigned certificate you obtained in the last step of Boulder, so go to the server VM, copy it and paste its contents.
-Now add the name that you gave to the CA in your certificate with its IP, e.g.
"192.168.122.128 CertificateAuthoritySTAR"

-Now test if you can access Boulder VM from proxy:
1. In the server, go to the boulder file and launch it:
$docker-compose build
$docker-compose up

2.When it ends launching (A message saying to press ^C pops at the end) go to the proxy and try to ping boulder:
$ping 172.17.0.4

If it works, stop Boulder:
	^C
	docker-compose rm
	y

If ping fails try $traceroute 172.17.0.4 to see where the message gets lost. Now go to the VM where the last jump was made
and check the route tables: $route
You must then add the routing for the 172.17.0.0 network and gateway 255.255.0.0, after it works stop Boulder as explained before.

*****************SIMULATION GUIDE*****************

HOW TO RUN A FULL SIMULATION

0. If you have restarted the server VM and want to ask for new certificates or mainly if some error happens but it is not fatal for the CA (if it is still UP), then
go to the proxy and execute: "sudo rm -rf /etc/letsencrypt"
1. In the server go to ~/gopath/src/github.com/letsencrypt/boulder
2. Run the renewalManager in background:
 	"go run renewalManager.go &"
	//Uncomment the line that says "Message" in function checkStatus() if you want to get notified when the renewal does a check.
	...and these 2 commands to run Boulder:
	docker-compose build
	docker-compose up

	And wait until it says "All servers running. Hit ^C to kill", the first time it may take a while

3. Go to proxy as superuser ("sudo -i") and type in ~/certbot# source ./venv/bin/activate
4. Then: export SERVER=http://172.17.0.4:4000/directory
4.5 If you just followed the installation there's not need to do 3 & 4, you just did them.
5. Now you are ready to go: "go run proxySTAR.go"
You will see a message: "Proxy STAR status in middlebox is: ACTIVE"
6. Go to client VM and POST at https://certProxy:443/star/registration (Don't forget to add certProxy to your /etc/hosts as the Proxy's IP).
	For now, the full command looks like this:
		curl --cacert /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/server.crt \
		-H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d \
		@fullCSR2 https://certProxy:443/star/registration

		*server.crt is an openssl cert I generated so proxy and client can use https, it is the same certificate that we obtained for the proxy with openSSL in the installation guide.
		*fullCSR2 is a textfile that contains a basic CSR with the domain name bye.com as SN field
		(subject name) plus lifetime and validity in format:

		{"csr":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\n
		MIICmDCCAYACAQAwUzELMAkGA1UEBhMCTU0xCjAIBgNVBAgMAWsxDDAKBgNVBAcM\n

		-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----","lifetime":365,"validity":21}

		To generate this text file first generate a private key and a CSR:
		"openssl req -out CSR.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout privateKey.key"

		See its contents:
		"cat CSR.csr"

		And copy it into a new file following the format above. Dont forget to add lifetime and validity at the end and "\n"
		after each row. I ll remove this asap to make it less tedious.

7. After the client executes the command in step 6 it will get a message similar to this one:
"Location: https://certProxy/star/registration/0"
 Now if the client goes to this URI: "curl --cacert /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/server.crt https://certProxy:443/star/registration/0"
 It will get a message back. This response can be {pending} or {status, lifetime,the uuid4 that serves as URI}
 E.g. {valid 365 20b1bac1-db72-42f4-9620-add03c789e36}
8. Then the client can retrieve the chained cert by using:
	"curl --cacert ./serverKey/cert.pem https://CertificateAuthoritySTAR:9898/20b1bac1-db72-42f4-9620-add03c789e36"

	*20b1bac1...is this example's certificate URI
	*cert.pem is the certificate that validates that the communications are safe with the renewalManager running in the CA. It is the same cert
	that was obtained in the last step of the Simulation Guide for the Server side.


9. To check that the renewalManager has done it's job -or if you forgot to run it, you can do so now and it will still work- put the Boulder in background:
"^Z"
"bg"
And check the crontab: "sudo crontab -l",

10. Renewals will be at the same URI that the first certificate, so DNO is not needed and can be turned OFF if you want so.

11.Note that a new directory has been created in the Server VM, this directory contains NEEDED information for the renewal so deleting it will cause renewals to fail.

12. To test the termination enter in the proxy and type "go run termination $uuid",
with the $uuid being the uuid where the certificate to terminate is renewed.

*****************ROUND-TRIPS GUIDE*****************

Time 0:
	SERVER:
		Boulder is running
		RenewalManager in the CA is running
	Proxy:
		Proxy is running
		Proxy hosts a web using apache

	Communication between Proxy and Client is safe: Proxy has a cert issued by openssl and the client acknowledges the site as safe.
	READ BOTH INSTALLATION AND SIMULATION GUIDE IF YOU ARE ALREADY LOST :)

Time 1:

	Client:
			It calls the proxy with https by using the certificate with argument --cacert:

			curl --cacert /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/server.crt -H \
			"Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d @fullCSR https://cert\
			Proxy:443/star/registration

	Proxy: proxySTAR.go
			function parseJsonPOST handles :443 /star/registration requests

			parseJsonPOST translates the block of data into a struct {csr,lifetime, validity}
			if lifetime and validity are appropiate it then proceeds to call decodeCsr.

			func decodeCsr uses a helper script called getCsrAsText.sh and finally returns the csr field
			as plain text, keeping a copy in the file tmpCsr, that will be deleted afterwards.

			Back in parseJsonPOST it uses the csr (now a string) as a parameter for func parseFieldsOfCsr.
			This function shall retrieve the domain contained in the csr field of the already mentioned struct and returns
			it as a string called subjectName.

			At this point in time, the proxy has info about: domain, lifetime and validity and has validated that both
			lifetime and validity are OK so it sends back the URL where the info about the certificate will be posted:

			Location: https://certProxy/star/registration/$ID

			As time goes on and multiple requests are made the $ID will increase.

			Function storeIssuedCerts is called. This will storage all the information
			processed by the proxy so that Certbot can read it when it gets executed.
			If these files dont exist Certbot client will ignore STAR.

			parseJsonPOST executes function callCertbot


Time 2:


	Proxy: proxySTAR.go

			function callCertbot runs cerbot application by passing the csr and the domain names as arguments.
			It uses cerbotCall.sh to do the execution.

	Proxy: Certbot
			Normal execution of the Certbot client with csr as a parameter but with 4 extra fields sent in the POST to
			Boulder added in acme/acme/client.py and messages.py.
			These fields are:
			{recurrent_cert_uuid,
			recurrent,
			recurrent_cert_validity,
			recurrent_cert_lifetime}

			recurrent_cert_uuid: contains the UUID where certificates will be posted
			recurrent: contains parameter true and it serves to turn STAR ON
			recurrent_cert_validity: validity for STAR certificates
			recurrent_cert_lifetime: contains the lifetime, so it is key for renewal

			When certbot is called it checks if file the tmp files with the STAR information exist, if so, it then reads the
			these files, deletes them and sends them to Boulder in the same certificate request.

	Boulder: wfe.go
			If Boulder function verifyPOST reads field "recurrent: true" in the Json sent by Certbot then it starts STAR. It
			reads all the recurrent fields and saves them into temporary files and finally to a directory with these
			features:
				The main directory is "./starCerts" and will be created in the same directory where Boulder is. This
				means, in my case it is in:

				~/gopath/src/github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/starCerts

				In ./starCerts files with the cert uuid as its name will be created, inside each file the info for the
				certificate renewal will be storaged:

				certificate.pem
				csr
				validity

				Why lifetime isn't in this file will be explained later.

			Before the csr is saved, STAR function repairCsr will make sure the csr is valid for future operations. The
			reason why this is a MUST is because at this point the csr has lost its base64 format and has lost the
			noninformation bits(stuffing).


			After this operation, server operations continue as normal, forwarding the csr until it reaches the CA.

	Boulder: ca.go

			When the time to create the certificate comes, function issueCertificate looks for the temporary files created
			in wfe.go and if it finds them, it issues a short-term certificate. If it doesn't find it, duration is set to 3
			months.

			WARNING: In case the config file is set to other value it won't read it.

			STAR function postAtUuid serves the file certificate.pem at:
			172.17.0.4:9898/$URI
			this means that it will be serving a STAR certificate for every STAR URI.

			STAR function addSTARToCron creates a file called "./renewMTmp/renew1" and it
			saves info for the renewals: {domain, lifetime, uuid}
			The reason why it saves information for the renewal instead of just adding it
			to cron right away is because ca.go is running inside a docker and the docker
			doesn't have a crontab so another process running outside of the docker needs to
			pick up the information inside this file "./renewMTmp/renew1" and add it to the
			system's crontab.

	Boulder: ra.go

			Function NewCertificate checks if STAR is ON (again thanks to the tmp files) and then storages the
			certificate in the file certificate.pem mentioned before, the key part is that it adds a chain of
			certificates by using the CA root certificate.

Time 3:

	Proxy: certbot

		Proxy's certbot side receives confirmation that the certificate challenge and certificate issuance have succeeded.

	Proxy: proxySTAR.go
		proxy then storages all the info about the certificate it just issued incluiding:
		certificate.pem: It is an isntace of the first certificate.
		csr: The csr the client used.
		uri: The uri where the STAR certificates are posted (unique for each certificate)
		validity: validity of every STAR

		Keeping these files isn't NEEDED for STAR but because the Proxy is the real owner of the domains, it is considered that
		knowing what name delegations are active is key. What's more, keeping the uri will allow the DNO to terminate the
		renewals.

Time 4:


	Client:
		If the client executes a curl to reach /star/registration/$ID will obtain:
		{
			status: valid,
			lifetime: 365, //just an example
			certificate: 609577eb-f47b-4443-8df6-ba926dbdcd6c //URI where the certificate is
																												//available at 172.17.0.4:9898
		}

Time 5:


		CA: renewalManager.go
			The renewal manager is running in the CA background.
			It tries to read file "./renewMTmp/renew1" every 10 seconds (this time can be modified in function checkStatus)
			and adds a cronjob that will execute itself every 24h and will look like this:

			50 8 * * * sh /home/acme-server2/gopath/src/github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/exeAutoRenew.sh  bye7.com 04 08
			6d53bdbb-beed-41d5-ae12-fe71bfe71b880ea26

			The first 5 parameters ensure the 24h execution at 8:50 everyday.
			The next one is a script: exeAutoRenew.sh that executes with 4 parameters:
			{domain, day and month when the lifetime expires(NOTE: it is the STAR lifetime, not a cert's lifetime), uri}

		CA: exeAutoRenew.sh
			This script first checks if its day&month arguments match the current day, if they match, it deletes the cronjob
			that executes this script every 24h.
			If they don't match, it means certificate's lifetime hasn't expired and will renew the cert.
			The cert is renew using openssl with all the parameters that had been saved so a new certificate will be
			generated.
			The most important part of this new issued certificate is that it contains the same key Boulder uses and that is
			located in boulder/test/test-ca.key
